# CS771A-Project
This repository contains the code for the course project of CS771A. In this attempt at learning machine learning we implemented Transfer Learning the database for Emotion Recognition in the Wild challenge, 2016.
We take the still image dataset and run it through a Deep neural network of 2 hidden layers. We then take the weights from the last layers and treat it as input to different classifiers for a comparitive study.
